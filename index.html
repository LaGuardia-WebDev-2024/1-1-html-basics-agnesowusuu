  <h1> Only If
 </h1>
  
 
  <h2>
    Song by Steve Lacy  
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    If I could travel through time, I think I <br>
Would tell myself from the past, "You'll be fine"<br>
But what you don't know is the fun part of fashion <br>
And it's the place where I think all the fun begins<br>
What you don't see is what you believe<br>
But to be is the place where the angels dance<br>
What you don't hear is the voice of fear<br>
When you get passed, that is when your life appears<br>
What you don't touch is what you won't clutch<br>
But you'll latch on tight when the coast is clear<br>
If I could travel through time, I think I<br>
Would tell myself from the past, "You'll be fine"
